### Issue with LXQt Menu Data Missing on Ubuntu 24.04

For unknown reasons, after installing LXQt on a fresh Ubuntu Server 24.04, files from the `lxqt-menu-data` package were missing. This resulted in incorrect menu displays, affecting the main menu, the view under Settings -> LXQt System Settings -> Configuration Center, and the options under "Open with" -> Other Applications. A simple `sudo apt install --reinstall lxqt` did not resolve the issue.

### Problem:
Despite reinstalling LXQt, certain menu files and translations were missing, causing the "Open with" menu to malfunction and category names to be absent.

### Cause:
A specific package (`lxqt-menu-data`) that contains the menu structure and translations was corrupted or incompletely installed. A general reinstallation of LXQt (`apt install --reinstall lxqt`) does not necessarily reinstall all related packages completely.

### Solution:
By specifically removing and reinstalling the `lxqt-menu-data` package, the problem was resolved:

sudo apt purge lxqt-menu-data
sudo apt install lxqt-menu-data

These steps ensure that all necessary files and translations for the menus are correctly installed.

### Insight:
When encountering issues with specific components or functionalities after reinstalling a desktop environment or similar software, it is advisable to check and, if necessary, reinstall the associated packages directly.
